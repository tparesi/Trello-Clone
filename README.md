# Trello-Clone

This project is a Trello inspired clone. The project is not finished. The focus on the project was gaining experience with jQuery and the jQuery UI library.

The backend was provided as a template and the front end was the focus of the project. This was a two day project, so there is still a lot of functionality missing.

My last commit was getting the draggable UI to work client side, but I have not yet integrated it into the backend. I will probably not continue on this project as it was just a stepping stone to starting bigger projects.
